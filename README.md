### Hello and welcome to my CS50 final project. 

Here I will be exploring reinforcement learning (RL), a type of machine learning that aims to interact with an environment in order to improve. Unlike machine learning methods you are probably used to (do not worry if you are not) RL needs to interact with this environment in order to learn. A great example of RL comes from DeepMind where they produced an agent that learnt to play atari games to a human level and above! This project will not be tackling tasks at that level however, I will be exploring what is called "The multi-armed bandit problem". This is a much simpler version of the full RL problem and can be thought of like going to the casino and playing the slot machines. I will explain it in much more detail below.

Once this project is complete, feel free to clone the repo and have a play around with the code, I will also include my references and links to their blogs/code at the bottom of the file. Jump straight there to see my inspirati
